## ProgBlog Redesign offers a more comprehensive look, email list

The ProgBlog team is pleased to announce our redesign of the site.  We've been growing rapidly in the past few months and decided it was time to step up our game â€“ hopefully you agree with us when we say it looks much nicer!

To keep this short, I want to announce our email list! Sign up for updates as we post new content.

As always, thanks for visiting, and let us know if there is something particular you would like to read about!

Best,

Richard Jeffords<br>Editor
